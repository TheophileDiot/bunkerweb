3. BusyBox
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable.
It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in bzip2, coreutils, dhcp, diffutils, e2fsprogs, file, findutils, gawk, grep, inetutils, less,  modutils, net-tools, procps, sed, shadow, sysklogd, sysvinit, tar, util-linux, and vim.
The utilities in BusyBox often have fewer options than their full-featured cousins, however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their larger counterparts.
